# PythonSnakeGame
SnakeGame is a simple yet charming remake of the classic Google Doodle Snake game, built by a beginner Python developer eager to dive into game development. This project captures the nostalgic feel of the original while serving as a fun learning experience.

Key Features:

Classic Snake Gameplay – Players control a snake that grows longer each time it eats an apple, while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself.

Clean, Retro Aesthetic – Inspired by the Google Doodle style, SnakeGame uses a grid-based, colorful design with bold and easy-to-see visuals.

Responsive Controls – Arrow key navigation allows smooth movement in all four directions.

Score Tracking – The score increases with each apple eaten, challenging players to beat their own high scores.

Game Over Animation – A friendly game over screen appears when the snake collides with itself or the wall, with an option to restart and try again.

Built With:

Python

Pygame (for graphics, input, and screen management)

Learning Objectives:
SnakeGame was created as a fun and interactive way to learn essential programming concepts like:

Loops and conditionals

Collision detection

Real-time input handling

Game loops and rendering

Note:
SnakeGame is a safe, lightweight project ideal for coders just starting out with Python. It’s perfect for showcasing early game dev skills or just having a bit of nostalgic fun!
